# shinyCI

A shinyApp to experience Confidence Intervals (CI).

This tiny shinyApp is supposed to be used for didactical reasons. The motivation 
behind this little project is to make transparent how the constituents of a 
Confidence Interval (test value, reliability, and confidence level) affect the width and hence
the interpretation of the respective CI. 


## Deploying this App

The current version of this app can be used here:

## ToDo
 
* as yet, shinyCI only works for T-values (hard-coded). It would be great if one could select between
different scales (IQ, Z, etc.)
