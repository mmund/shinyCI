# shinyCI

A shiny app to experience confidence intervals.

This is a tiny shiny App supposed to be used for didactical reasons. The motivation 
behind this little project is to make visible how the constituents of a 
Confidence Interval (Reliability and Confidence Level) affect the width and hence
the interpretation of the respective CI. 

**BEWARE:** Code is still messy yet...
